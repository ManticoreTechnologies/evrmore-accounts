# Evrmore Accounts Security Audit Report

**Prepared by**: Manticore Technologies Security Team  
**Date**: February 15, 2024  
**Version**: 1.0  

## Executive Summary

This document presents the findings from a comprehensive security audit of the Evrmore Accounts authentication system. The audit focused on analyzing the backend implementation's security measures, performance optimizations, and adherence to best practices.

Evrmore Accounts provides wallet-based authentication for Evrmore blockchain applications, including features such as JWT token management, two-factor authentication, and user profile management. The system is designed to be a secure, reliable authentication solution for web3 applications built on the Evrmore blockchain.

## Scope

The audit covered the following components and features:

- Wallet-based authentication flow
- JWT token security and session management
- Two-factor authentication (TOTP)
- CORS and security headers
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- API endpoint security
- Database security
- Password and key management
- Logging and monitoring
- Code quality and performance

## Key Findings

### Strengths

1. **Blockchain-based Authentication**: The use of Evrmore blockchain signatures for authentication provides a strong cryptographic foundation.
2. **JWT Implementation**: The JWT token management appears to follow best practices, with proper token signing and validation.
3. **Two-Factor Authentication**: The TOTP implementation is sound and follows standard practices.
4. **API Design**: The API is well-structured with clear endpoints and authorization requirements.
5. **Data Persistence**: The system properly secures sensitive data in the database.

### Vulnerabilities and Recommendations

#### Critical Issues

None identified.

#### High Severity Issues

1. **Session Management Improvement**
   - **Finding**: The absence of an active session tracking system may allow attackers to use tokens even after a user has logged out on another device.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement a centralized session registry that tracks all active tokens and allows for forced invalidation.

2. **Rate Limiting Enhancement**
   - **Finding**: While rate limiting exists, it may not be sufficiently robust against distributed attacks.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement more sophisticated rate limiting based on IP ranges and add CAPTCHA for suspicious activity.

#### Medium Severity Issues

1. **Security Headers**
   - **Finding**: Some recommended security headers are missing from API responses.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement all recommended security headers including Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, and Strict-Transport-Security.

2. **Error Handling**
   - **Finding**: Some error responses may reveal too much information about the system.
   - **Recommendation**: Standardize error responses to avoid leaking implementation details.

3. **WebAuthn Support**
   - **Finding**: The system currently only supports TOTP for 2FA.
   - **Recommendation**: Add support for WebAuthn (FIDO2) to enable hardware security keys and biometric authentication.

#### Low Severity Issues

1. **Documentation**
   - **Finding**: API documentation could be more comprehensive.
   - **Recommendation**: Enhance API documentation with more examples and security considerations.

2. **Logging Enhancements**
   - **Finding**: Security event logging could be more detailed for forensic analysis.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement more comprehensive logging of authentication events, including IP addresses and device information.

## Detailed Analysis

### Wallet-based Authentication

The wallet-based authentication flow correctly implements the challenge-signature verification process:

1. The system generates a random challenge for the user
2. The user signs the challenge with their Evrmore wallet
3. The signature is verified against the Evrmore address
4. Upon successful verification, a JWT token is issued

**Recommendations**:
- Add a nonce to the challenge to prevent replay attacks
- Consider adding a signature timestamp to limit the validity period of signatures

### JWT Token Security

The JWT implementation uses proper algorithms and includes necessary claims:

- Tokens are properly signed using a secure algorithm
- Expiration times are reasonable
- Token validation is properly enforced

**Recommendations**:
- Consider implementing token rotation for long-lived sessions
- Add fingerprinting data to tokens to bind them to specific devices or browsers

### Two-Factor Authentication

The TOTP implementation follows industry standards:

- Secret generation is secure
- QR code provisioning works correctly
- Verification includes proper time-based validation

**Recommendations**:
- Add backup codes for account recovery
- Implement WebAuthn support for hardware security keys
- Add rate limiting specifically for 2FA attempts

### API Security

The API endpoints are well-structured and follow REST principles:

- Authentication is properly required for protected endpoints
- Input validation appears to be in place
- CORS is configured correctly

**Recommendations**:
- Add input sanitization to all user-provided data
- Implement parameter validation using JSON schema
- Consider API versioning for future compatibility

### Performance and Scalability

The system appears to be designed for scalability:

- Stateless authentication allows for horizontal scaling
- Database operations appear to be optimized
- Response times are generally acceptable

**Recommendations**:
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Consider adding a CDN for static assets
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing

## Conclusion

Evrmore Accounts provides a solid foundation for secure authentication in Evrmore blockchain applications. While there are some areas for improvement, particularly around session management and advanced security features, the core functionality is secure and well-implemented.

By addressing the recommendations in this report, the system can be further hardened against potential attacks and provide an even more robust authentication solution.

## Action Items

### High Priority

1. Implement centralized session tracking and management
2. Enhance rate limiting with more sophisticated rules
3. Add all recommended security headers

### Medium Priority

1. Standardize error responses
2. Implement WebAuthn support
3. Add backup codes for 2FA recovery

### Low Priority

1. Enhance API documentation
2. Improve security event logging
3. Implement token rotation for long sessions
