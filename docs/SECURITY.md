# Evrmore Accounts Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security features and best practices implemented in the Evrmore Accounts authentication system. The system is designed to provide secure blockchain-based authentication for Evrmore applications.

## Security Features

### Authentication Security

1. **Blockchain-Based Authentication**
   - Uses cryptographic signatures from Evrmore wallets for authentication
   - Multiple signature verification methods for maximum compatibility
   - Challenge-response mechanism with expiration times
   - Protection against replay attacks

2. **JWT Token Security**
   - Secure token generation with proper algorithms (HS256)
   - Short-lived access tokens (1 hour by default)
   - Token fingerprinting to bind tokens to devices
   - Token revocation capabilities
   - JTI (JWT ID) tracking for token management

3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   - TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) support
   - WebAuthn (FIDO2) support for hardware security keys
   - Recovery codes for account recovery
   - Rate limiting for 2FA attempts

### Infrastructure Security

1. **Security Headers**
   - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
   - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
   - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Helps prevent XSS attacks
   - `Strict-Transport-Security` - Enforces HTTPS
   - `Content-Security-Policy` - Restricts resource loading
   - `Referrer-Policy` - Controls referrer information

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - IP-based rate limiting
   - Endpoint-specific limits
   - Whitelist and blacklist support
   - Exponential backoff for repeated failures

3. **Session Management**
   - Active session tracking
   - Device fingerprinting
   - Session revocation capabilities
   - Automatic cleanup of expired sessions

4. **Error Handling**
   - Standardized error responses
   - Appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Minimal information disclosure
   - Detailed logging for debugging

5. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Security event logging
   - Authentication attempt tracking
   - Suspicious activity detection
   - Request ID tracking for correlation

## Security Best Practices

1. **Password and Key Management**
   - Secure storage of JWT secret keys
   - Environment variable configuration
   - No hardcoded secrets

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validation of all user inputs
   - Sanitization of data before processing
   - Protection against injection attacks

3. **Output Encoding**
   - Proper encoding of output data
   - Content-Type headers for all responses
   - JSON encoding for API responses

4. **Secure Defaults**
   - Security features enabled by default
   - Secure configuration out of the box
   - Fail-secure approach

## Security Testing

The repository includes a security testing script (`test_security.py`) that checks for proper implementation of security features:

```bash
python3 test_security.py --url http://localhost:5000
```

This script tests:
- Security headers
- Rate limiting
- JWT token security
- Error handling

## Security Recommendations

For production deployments, we recommend:

1. **Use HTTPS**
   - Always deploy behind HTTPS
   - Use a valid SSL certificate
   - Configure proper HSTS headers

2. **Secure Environment**
   - Use a secure hosting environment
   - Implement network-level security
   - Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)

3. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Monitor for security advisories
   - Apply security patches promptly

4. **Security Monitoring**
   - Implement intrusion detection
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Set up alerts for security events

5. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Conduct regular security audits
   - Perform penetration testing
   - Review security configurations
